        <h1>Zach Williams: A Brief Biography</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Zach Williams. 
I am a junior at Syracuse University studying Systems & Information Science,
with interests in web design, software programming, and data science. 
I have acquired some experience in various coding languages (Java, C, Python, HTML, etc.) and was a DJ at my local radio station. Iâ€™ve performed on stage at Carnegie Hall, won a local spelling bee, and co-authored a book with fellow students at a student technology program. My favorite things to do include remembering useless movie trivia, playing video games, and messing around with my annoying cat.</p>
