                <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
            
                <p>Zach Williams was born in New York City. He lived with his older sister and his parents for several years. <br>He was gifted at a young age, learning how to read much higher than his grade level.
                    During elementary school, Zach became talented at playing the trumpet, but also talented at disrupting the class.
                    After a divorce and several moves, he and his family settled in Westchester County, where he would attend high school. 
                    During this period, Zach stayed out of trouble and mostly kept to himself. Continuing his Trumpeting in Concert Band, Zach performed on stage at Carnegie Hall. </p>
