                    <h2>Judas and the Black Messiah</h2>
                    <p>An absolutely heartbreaking and frustrating showcase of justified black nationalism demonized and propagandized by corrupt white men in power. The scary part is knowing O’Neal wasn’t the only vessel they used to collapse the party. Hampton’s words still ring true to this day and I’m thankful they’re being carried out by his family and this film.</p>

                    <h2>Parasite</h2>
                    <p>Extremely glad this won Best Picture, being the first international film to win the award in America. Director Bong Joon-Ho makes a funny, disturbing, biting take on classism and the human condition. Park So-Dam and Song Kang-Ho play their roles with so much joy it sucks you in almost immediately.<br>Watching this in the theater was way too much fun, before the halfway point turned into a tense thriller and the ending a chaotic finish. Had no idea where this film would take me next, but I’m glad I got on the ride.</p>

                    <h2>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</h2>
                    <p>Sacha Baron Cohen, with hilarious and convincing newcomer Maria Bakalova, continues to push the boundaries of social and cultural norms as his trademark foreigner character, although some of what used to be downright shocking 14 years ago has become our new normal. It isn’t quite ad fresh as the original Borat, but still packs plenty of wild situations to make it worth watching. You still gain a sense of dread watching what horrible things our two leads will say and do to a real crowd that is unaware of the whole joke.<br>
                    I will say I was surprised by how well the film recovered in the wake of the ongoing pandemic and how it weaved itself into the film plot. But the debutante ball scene will haunt my dreams forever.</p>
