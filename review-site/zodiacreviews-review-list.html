                    <h2>Goodfellas</h2>
                    <p>My all-time favorite movie. So many iconic shots, so many badass one liners. Such career defining moments for the cast and crew. Scorsese nails the setting and gangster lifestyles perfectly, both positive and negative.<br>It’s so much fun to watch the rise and fall of a man swallowed up by criminal conspiracy as the fellow Goodfellas he so easily befriended start dropping off one by one. You can’t get much better than this folks.</p>

                    <h2>The Shawshank Redemption</h2>
                    <p>	One of my favorite films ever. Completely engrossing and thought provoking film about the closest, most loyal group of prisoners you’ve ever seen.<br>Everyone brings their A-game here: Director Frank Darabont’s beautiful adaptation of Stephen King’s novella, legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins’ sweeping shots of the prison, Thomas Newman’s music (especially the song introducing Shawshank), the entire cast (Morgan Freeman and Bob Gunton especially). It all comes together in an iconic climax that earns its satisfying ending. There’s so much to love about this movie and there’s a reason it’s considered a modern classic.</p>

                    <h2>Parasite</h2>
                    <p>Extremely glad this won Best Picture, being the first international film to win the award in America. Director Bong Joon-Ho makes a funny, disturbing, biting take on classism and the human condition. Park So-Dam and Song Kang-Ho play their roles with so much joy it sucks you in almost immediately.<br>Watching this in the theater was way too much fun, before the halfway point turned into a tense thriller and the ending a chaotic finish. Had no idea where this film would take me next, but I’m glad I got on the ride.</p>

                    <h2>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h2>
                    <p>“It’s so dense, every single image has so many things going on” except that the movie we got was actually good.<br>I’ve been a fan of Spider-Man for a long time, and when I learned about a Black-Puerto Rican Spider-Man from Donald Glover, I was way too excited. To finally see Miles Morales on the big screen was one of the best things I’ve gotten to experience. The story was unique to the other superhero movies coming out around the same time, it was very funny throughout, and the varied cast and gorgeous comic-themed animation made every scene pop.<br>The scene just before the climax of the film had me tearing up in joy. The mix of gorgeous cinematography and motivational soundtrack was too much for me to handle in the theatre. Never did I think a Spider-Man film could top the second Raimi movie. This beats it by a long shot.</p>

                    <h2>Hereditary</h2>
                    <p>My personal best horror film of the decade and it earns this through so many ways:<br>
                    	The cast is 100% excellent and has me confidently boarding the Toni Collette hype train. She was ROBBED of an Oscar nomination AND a win. Alex Wolff pulls off a realistically tormented teen filled with guilt and helplessness. Gabriel Byrne gives an understated and subtle role of the skeptic in the family. Molly Shapiro does a great job playing the “problem child”.<br>
                        The effects are disgustingly good, and the dinner scene is one of the best put to film. The build-up is slow but intriguing and carries needed tension into a fantastic, terrifying finale. I almost couldn’t sleep the night I saw this. And the more I watch it, the more I catch something new that adds to the film’s quality.
                        iv.	Please please PLEASE watch this, but don’t expect your average horror film.</p>

                    <h2>Knives Out</h2>
                    <p>You can tell that nearly every actor was having a blast making this movie, with special regards to Daniel Craig, Toni Collette, and Chris Evans. The script is sharp, funny, and surprisingly accurate to present-day politics and culture. The reveal of the mystery was smart and satisfying.</p>

Hampton’s words still ring true to this day and I’m thankful they’re being carried out by his family and this film.</p>

                    <h2>Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</h2>
                    <p>Sacha Baron Cohen, with hilarious and convincing newcomer Maria Bakalova, continues to push the boundaries of social and cultural norms as his trademark foreigner character, although some of what used to be downright shocking 14 years ago has become our new normal. It isn’t quite ad fresh as the original Borat, but still packs plenty of wild situations to make it worth watching. You still gain a sense of dread watching what horrible things our two leads will say and do to a real crowd that is unaware of the whole joke.<br>
                    I will say I was surprised by how well the film recovered in the wake of the ongoing pandemic and how it weaved itself into the film plot. But the debutante ball scene will haunt my dreams forever.</p>

                    <h2>Big Fat Liar</h2>
                    <p>My absolute guiltiest of pleasures. Paul Giamatti was clearly having the time of his life while on set. The script is pretty dumb and some of the overacting can get tiresome, but the premise is just so funny. Who doesn’t love a well-deserved revenge plot? Its plot structure is so early ‘00s and I adore it for that.</p>

                    <h2>Cruel Intentions</h2>
                    <p>I couldn’t get into the movie because I had a hard time believing a preppy jerk would commit such an abrupt about-face simply because he met a nice, pretty girl at school. However, Sarah Michelle Gellar is delightfully "cruel" in her performance, and the soundtrack, especially “Colorblind”, works in the movie’s favor.</p>

                    <h2>The Master of Disguise</h2>
                    <p>I loved this as a child, but I thoroughly dislike this as an adult. The dated (and pretty offensive) jokes don’t land, except for the recurring fart joke. And when the funniest parts of you movie are fart jokes, that indicates a pretty bad movie. This film is also super short, like they ran out of steam around the 60 minute mark. One third of it is outtakes and they're not even especially good outtakes. </p>

                    <h2>Crash</h2>
                    <p>Honestly, I am baffled that this film won the Oscar for Best Picture despite ruining its subject matter to this degree. There’s an interesting and thought provoking message buried under the uncomfortable and unrealistic racist behavior scattered throughout. The best-handled subplot in this film is the one with Michael Peña and his daughter, but the others come off as manipulative. The racism comparison scene in Do the Right Thing (1989) pulls off this idea significantly better.</p>

                    <h2>Artemis Fowl</h2>
                    <p>I am biased because I grew up reading the series this film is based on. I have never seen an adaptation quite so muddled, ugly, unfunny, inaccurate, and completely unearning of its title or final line. Who knows what great scenes we could have enjoyed instead of a Harry Potter knockoff lead and story changes that actually destroy the arcs of some of its characters?<br>This was supposed to be a start to a series? Good luck with that. Stick to the novels, written or graphic. It’s a better use of your time.</p>

                        What was M. Night Shyamalan thinking with this adaptation? None of the charm, humor, energy, vibrant colors, and enjoyable characters from the original acclaimed cartoon are reflected in this production. Not even the element bending is represented properly in a film that feels rushed, because it is rushing through the 20 episodes that make up the first season of the series.<br>
                    I originally thought Netflix couldn’t do worse than this, but the more I hear about, the more it reminds me of this train wreck. Possibly the biggest disappointment of my childhood.</p>

                    <p>This is one of the worst I’ve ever seen. My sister and I honestly had trouble finishing it.<br>The script is crap, the acting is crap, the directing is crap. Optimus Prime completely stops caring about helping the humans, betraying his loyal character. The film switches locations so abruptly that it’s like you walked into a different movie. The only good part of this is Stanley Tucci, who’s barely trying. I had no intention of watching any additional sequels after I saw this train wreck.</p>

                    <h2>Wish Upon</h2>
                    <p>Possibly the worst I have ever seen. The cast is fine in other things, but they do nothing for me here. The script is nonsensical and cliché, the kills are cheap and hilarious rather than scary, and the main character is so unbelievably stupid that you as a viewer are waiting for her to die (and then she does). The best use for this film is for a drinking game with your friends.</p>
